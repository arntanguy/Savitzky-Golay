### Introduction

Nicely computes the Vandermonde matrix, Savitzky-Golay differentiation filters and smoothing coefficients for any noisy, and sequential signal. It is a textbook implementation of the Savitzky-Golay Filter. Initial testing of this code was done using a Ubuntu 14.04.02 Trusty OS running Linux 4.4 but will work on any other Linux/Windows/Mac OS machine with little effort.

Below are examples of how the filter smoothes out a noisy depth map data from the kinect time-of-flight sensor:

### Dependencies

In order to compile this file, you would need to install the [Eigen3 Library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) to do the linear algebra of the matrices, vectors and related algorithms. You can install it by downloading the 3.2.5 library which I used from [here](http://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/3.2.5.tar.gz) and following the `README` instructions after unpacking the tarball to install. 

### Usage

* `./savgol`
  
  __Options__

  - -h or --help: print out helper menu for using code.

  - computes the savitzky-golay filter coefficients with frame size, `F = 5` and polynomial order 3 (these are the default parameters of the filter) for linearly spaced data points between `x_min = 900` and `x_max = 980`.

  - To change the values of the frame size and polynomial order, do

  `./savgoal 9 5` where `F = 9` and `k = 5`.

  - To pass in your arbitrary data points between a value x_min and x_max, pass in the following argum,ents in order: ./savgoal `F` `k` `x_min` `x_max`.

  The filtered values are returned onto the console. Note that the Frame size should ideally be odd

### RESULTS
The savgol filter tries to compute the moving average of the time-series data fed into it. For example, with a frame size of `9` and polynomial order of `5` for numbers linearly spaced between `100` and `1000`, we obtain the following results by running this code:

```bash
Frame size: 9; Polynomial order: 5 

 Vandermonde Matrix: 
     1     -4     16    -64    256  -1024   4096 -16384  65536
     1     -3      9    -27     81   -243    729  -2187 134737
     1     -2      4     -8     16    -32     64   -128      0
     1     -1      1     -1      1     -1      1     -1      1
     1      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0
     1      1      1      1      1      1      1      1      1
     1      2      4      8     16     32     64    128    256
     1      3      9     27     81    243    729   2187   6561
     1      4     16     64    256   1024   4096  16384  65536

Filtered values in the range 
  100 212.5   325 437.5   550 662.5   775 887.5  1000
 are: 
662.5   775 887.5  1000   550   100 212.5   325 437.5

```

Or for numbers linearly spaced between `100` and `300`, with `F = 7` and `k = 5`, we obtain:

```bash
Frame size: 7; polynomial order: 5 

 Vandermonde Matrix: 
     1     -3      9    -27     81   -243    729
     1     -2      4     -8     16    -32 134865
     1     -1      1     -1      1     -1      0
     1      0      0      0      0      0      0
     1      1      1      1      1      1      1
     1      2      4      8     16     32     64
     1      3      9     27     81    243    729


Filtered values in the range 
    100 133.333 166.667     200 233.333 266.667     300
 are: 
233.333 266.667     300     200     100 133.333 166.667
```

### Components
*  `MatrixXi vander(const int F);`
    	
    - computes the [vandermonde matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix) and the polynomial of basis vectors and flips it column-wise from left to right

*   `MatrixXf B = MatrixXf sgdiff(int k, double F);`	
		
	- designs a Savitzky-Golay FIR smoothing filter B with polynomial order _**k**_ and frame size _**F**_ of the convolution coefficients.  The polynomial order, _**k**_, must be less than the frame size _**F**_ and _**F**_ must be odd. 

*	`savgolfilt(x, x_on, k, F);`
	
	- computes the smoothed values of the signal x, whose tansient on is `x_on` initialized with size F.

*	**Note**
	In calculating the transient off, `x_off` will be the last `(F-1)` `x` values, where `x`'s are the data sequence we want to filter.If you are smoothing data offline, then this code will work seamlessly. Just load your data in the `main()` function where, for an example, I have used linearly spaced values between `900` and `980` at a frame `5` size for my steady state values. 
	
	Note, if you are smoothing data in real time, you need to find a way to let your compiler pick the last F-length samples from your data in order to compute your transient off, i.e., x_off. You could have the program wait for x_milliseconds after stopping your code before you pick the transient off, for example.

### Compilation

There is a `CMakeLists.txt` file in the project root folder. From the project root directory:

1.	Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. 	Compile the `cpp` code: 	`cmake ../`
3.	Build your executable: `make`
4. 	Run the executable:	`./savgol`
